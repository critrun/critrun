### Lore
Hi, I'm Anton also known as crit!\
Tall person in Sweden.\
I'm mostly interested in low-level development of firmware, be it RTOS or bare metal.\
Just recently started learning git (I should've much sooner).\
Outside of development I enjoy photography, entrepreneurship, math, art and parkour.\
I'm just a little guy, really.
